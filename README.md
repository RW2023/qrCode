## My process
Was very long and involved learning as I went. In the end the discovery of figma and becoming proficient in it's use was a big factor in the end result. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

The biggest thing I learned from this process was the proper use of classes for targeting styling css. Another big lesson I learned was in utilizing the mobile first workflow to ensure responsiveness. 



### Continued development

The entire challenge has highlighted my need for continued practice with CSS and design principles.


### Useful resources

- [Figma ](https://www.figma.com/) - This helped a lot with visualizing the design.
